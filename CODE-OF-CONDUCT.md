We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event.

We value your attendance.
